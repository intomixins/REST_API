REGISTRATION:
/registration - you need to input username, password, email and about_me field.
/verify - you need to input email and OTP code that you got on your email


USAGE:
/auth/jwt/create - endpoint, where you got your JWT
/auth/jwt/refresh - endpoint, where you can refresh your JWT
/api/users - all users (only authorized users can see)
/auth/users/me - fetching user profile (
    DELETE METHOD - input password, and you will delete your user,
    PATCH/PUT METHOD - input one/all colomn to change in your user account,
)
last 2 endpoints work correctly, only if you add Authorization header, which /auth/jwt/create gives you
